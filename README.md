 Offline Mesh
  Decentralized Offline Communication System

● Overview
OfflineMesh is a conceptual decentralized communication system designed to enable messaging, file sharing, and image transfer without internet access.

The system uses a mesh-based architecture where devices act as nodes that forward data between each other.

● Problem Statement
In disaster zones, rural areas, or during internet shutdowns, communication becomes impossible. OfflineMesh proposes a solution using peer-to-peer device networking.

● System Architecture
- Mesh node structure
- Peer discovery mechanism
- Message routing model
- Data relay system

●  Features (Conceptual)
- Offline messaging
- Photo and file sharing
- Multi-hop communication
- No central server required

●  Documentation
- Project Overview PDF
- Demo Simulation PDF

●  Future Development
The project can be implemented using:
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi Direct
- Device-to-device communication protocols.
