 OfflineMesh
 - Decentralized Offline Communication System

 Overview
-OfflineMesh is a conceptual decentralized communication system designed to enable messaging, file sharing, and image transfer without internet access.

The system uses a mesh-based architecture where devices act as nodes that forward data between each other.

Problem Statement
- In disaster zones, rural areas, or during internet shutdowns, communication becomes impossible. OfflineMesh proposes a peer-to-peer solution that allows devices to relay messages across a decentralized network.

 System Architecture
- Mesh node structure
- Peer discovery mechanism
- Multi-hop message routing
- Data relay system

Key Features
- Offline messaging
- Photo and file sharing
- Multi-hop communication
- No central server required

- Demo Simulation PDF(OfflineMesh_Stimulation_ demo.PDF)

 Future Scope
 This concept can be implemented using:
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi Direct
- Device-to-device networking protocols.
