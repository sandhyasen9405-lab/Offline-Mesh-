 OfflineMesh Simulation Demo

Proof-of-concept implementation of decentralized peer-to-peer message routing without internet infrastructure.

Project Overview

OfflineMesh is a decentralized communication concept designed for areas with no internet connectivity.

The system allows nearby devices to communicate directly using peer-to-peer mesh networking without relying on networks or Wi-Fi routers.

This notebook demonstrates a simulation of how offline message routing can work between multiple nodes.

""" Simulation Output Explanation

The message originates from Device A and travels through connected devices in a mesh-like structure.
This demonstrates how peer-to-peer routing can function even without centralized internet infrastructure.
